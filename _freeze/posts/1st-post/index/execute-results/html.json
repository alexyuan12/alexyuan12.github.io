This post is still in progress.\"\nauthor:\n  - name: \"Alex Yuan\"\ncategories: [Analysis, Probability, Information Theory]\ndraft: false\n---\n\n\nWhile one learns all about $\\sigma$-algebras and other types of closure structures in measure theory, often it is just for the sake of defining the domain of a measure. We can however develop some decent intution regarding these structures through a information-theoretic lense.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nConsider the statements:\\\n1) \"In retrospect it was a bad idea to buy tech stocks.\"\\\n2) \"Tom knows more about nutrition than Jerry does.\"\\\n3) \"Tom and Jerry each know things about nutrition which the other does not.\"\\\n4) \"You learn something new each day.\"\\\n5) \"When I played that poker hand, my opponent did know that I saw his cards.\"\n\nEach of these is a statement about knowledge, or the lack thereof. In particular, each\ncompares the states of knowledge of two agents (or the same agent at different times). How can we mathematically\nmodel this though? \n\nThe appropriate and natural mathematical model of a knowledge-state is a sigma-algebra.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be a sigma algebra over some set $\\Omega$ and suppose $w\\in\\Omega$ is the unknown state of a system $\\mathcal{S}$. The knowledge represented by $\\mathcal{F}$ is the information about $\\mathcal{S}$ that one obtains from observing for every $U \\in \\mathcal{F}$ whether or not $w \\in U$. Thus, it should be natural that if another sigma algebra $\\mathcal{D} \\supset \\mathcal{F}$ then we say $\\mathcal{D}$ contains \"more\" information than $\\mathcal{F}$.\\\n\nIf one remembers back to the first examples of $\\sigma$-algebras, it becomes obvious that $\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)$ represents a state of total omniscience, while $\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega\\}$ represents a state of total ignorance.\n\nLet $(X, \\mathcal{X})$ and $(Y, \\mathcal{Y})$ be measurable spaces. If $\\mathcal{X}$ contains strictly more information (in the sense that we could recover every bit of information about $\\mathcal{Y}$ by observing $\\mathcal{X}$) than $\\mathcal{Y}$ then we say $\\mathcal{X}$ refines $\\mathcal{Y}$. One can think of this as saying once we have observed the information contained in $\\mathcal{X}$, the information in $\\mathcal{Y}$ would be redundant.\n\nWe say that $\\mathcal{X}$ ***refines*** $\\mathcal{Y}$ if $\\mathcal{Y}$ is a subset of $\\mathcal{X}$. This is almost analogous to the discussion of coarse and fine topologies.\n\n\nLet $(X,\\mathcal{X})$ be a measurable space, and let $\\mathbb{T}$ be a linearly ordered set.\nA $\\mathbb{T}$-indexed ***filtration*** is a collection $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{T}}$ of\n$\\sigma$-subalgebras of $\\mathcal{X}$ such that, for any $s,t\\in\\mathbb{T}$,\n$$\ns < t \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; \\mathcal{F}_s \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_t .\n$$\n\n\nThe opposite of the concept of refinement is the concept of ***independence***. If $\\mathcal{Y}$ contains no information about $\\mathcal{X},$ then the information contained in the two $\\sigma$-algebras is *complementary*, meaning each one tells us things the other does not.\n\nHeuristically, if we observed the information about both $\\sigma$-algebras \nthen we would have \"twice\" as much information as if we only observed one or the other. We then say $\\mathcal{X}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}$ are independent of one another. \nWith these ideas in hand, we give a definition for independence of sets and independence of $\\sigma$-algebras.\n\nLet $(X,\\mathcal{X},\\mu)$ be a measure space, and $U,V \\in \\mathcal{X}$. We say the sets $U$ and $V$ are ***independent*** if\n$$\n\\mu(U \\cap V) \\;=\\; \\mu(U)\\,\\mu(V)\n$$\n\nLet $\\mathcal{Y}_1, \\mathcal{Y}_2 \\subset \\mathcal{X}$ be two $\\sigma$-subalgebras. We say $\\mathcal{Y}_1$ and $\\mathcal{Y}_2$ are ***independent*** $\\sigma$-algebras if every element of $\\mathcal{Y}_1$ is independent of every element of $\\mathcal{Y}_2$ \nwith respect to the measure $\\mu$. In other words, for all $U_1 \\in \\mathcal{Y}_1$ and $U_2 \\in \\mathcal{Y}_2$, we have\n$$\n\\mu(U_1 \\cap U_2) \\;=\\; \\mu(U_1)\\,\\mu(U_2)\n$$\n\n### Example:\n\n\n\n\n\n",
