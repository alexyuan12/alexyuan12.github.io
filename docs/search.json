    "text": "Books\n\nAnalysis:\nPrinciples of Mathematical Analysis (Walter Rudin):\nA notorious undergraduate textbook for good reason. It is very terse on a first read, but it has everything you need to know about analysis at the undergraduate level. Most people who have read this book tend to agree that chapters 1-7 are essential. I don’t think this is a good book to learn from unless you have other resources or an instructor. The exercises are pretty difficult.\nAn Introduction to Hilbert Space (Nicholas Young):\nAn introduction to functional analysis, focusing heavily on the theory of Hilbert spaces and their applications. It’s very concise and readable without getting into the more abstract measure theoretical issues. I think this book reads well and has nice exercises built into the body of the text.\nAnalysis (Elliot Lieb, Michael Loss):\nSupposedly a good introduction to analysis at the graduate level. The focus is more on ‘applied’ analysis and is good for getting up to speed quickly. I think the book is tailored more to those interested in physics and partial differential equations. I’ve been told that the exercises are good qualifying exam practice.\nReal Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications (Gerald Folland):\nIt is a standard analysis textbook at the graduate level along with the other books by Rudin, Royden, etc. It covers measure theory, point-set topology, functional analysis, and some other relevant topics. The analysis done in this book is very general, however it is very well written albeit terse at times.\n(Currently going through this.)\nFunctional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces and Partial Differential Equations (Haim Brezis):\nThis is a standard textbook for functional analysis (with a view of PDEs) at the graduate level. I have only read a couple pages about Hanh-Banach, but supposedly it is a must read for those interested in partial differential equations.\n\n\nProbability:\nProbability Theory and Examples (Rick Durrett):\nThis is a standard graduate text on probability. It is terse and has some annoying/unstandard notation. I think this book is unreadable if you do not have an instructor handy or previous background in measure theory. I would recommend skipping the measure theory intro if you already know it. Despite these issues, the coverage of topics and examples is great.\n(Currently going through this.)\nProbability and Measure (Patrick Billingsley):\nThis is supposedly the reference on probability theory. I have skimmed parts of it, and it is very terse. I have been told that if you want to pursue a research career in probability theory, Billingsley is a must read.\nMeasure Theory and Probability Theory (Krishna Athreya, Soumendra Lahiri):\nThis is a book that was just brought to my attention at the time of writing (August 2025). It seems to be sort of similar in spirit to Billingsley, and it takes a general approach from the beginning. Skimming through, it seems to try to offer a lot of intuition on the measure theoretic details.\nHigh-Dimensional Probability (Roman Vershynin):\nA book on probability in high dimensions. It is pedagogically sound and is a pretty different flavor compared to other probability texts. No measure theory is requried. The exercises are great, and I think there is a lot of motivation in data science for the results in the book.\n(Currently going through this.)\n\n\nStatistics:\nStatistical Inference (George Casella, Roger Berger):\nThis is the definitive ‘mathematical statistics’ book at the masters level. I think many schools also draw their qualifying exam material/questions out of this book. I think it can be a little unmotivated at times and even a bit hand-wavy, but most people think it is the best book around this level. Some people suggest supplementing this book with Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly, et al. as the book is slower and does a better job with motivating the material.\nMathematical Statistics (Jun Shao):\nA ‘mathematical statistics’ book at the PhD level. It pretty much expects you to have had a graduate probability course or equivalent from the get-go. It is supposed to prepare you for PhD statistics qualifiers and is a good resource for exercises as there is an associated solutions manual. I am currently going through this.\n(Currently going through this.)\nHigh-Dimensional Statistics: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint (Martin Wainwright):\n\n\n\nML/AI:\nElements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, et al.) \nConsidered classic introduction to ML with a statistical view. It’s kind of a weird blend of some theory and application. I think the authors underestimate the pre-requisites they state in the beginning. In my opinion, if you don’t have a decent linear models/linear algebra background, the book is nearly unreadable.\nStatistical Learning with Sparsity (Hastie, et al.) \nI have a copy of this book and it looks like a good exposition of the LASSO (considering Robert Tibshirani is an author), as well as other methods with a focus on sparsity for high dimensions.\n\n\nOptimization:\nNumerical Optimization (Jorge Nocedal, Stephen J. Wright):\n\nConvex Optimization (Lieven Vandenberghe, Stephen Boyd):\n\n\n\nDifferential Geometry:\nAn Introduction to Manifolds (Loring Tu):\nA great introduction to smooth manifolds. The appendix on point-set topology is excellent.\n(Currently going through this.)\nIntroduction to Smooth Manifolds (John M. Lee):\nAnother great introduction to smooth manifolds. This book is much slower than Tu and covers a lot more content.\n(Currently going through this.)"

    "text": "While one learns all about \\(\\sigma\\)-algebras and other types of closure structures in measure theory, often it is just for the sake of defining the domain of a measure. We can however develop some decent intution regarding these structures through a information-theoretic lense.\nConsider the statements:\n1) “In retrospect it was a bad idea to buy tech stocks.”\n2) “Tom knows more about nutrition than Jerry does.”\n3) “Tom and Jerry each know things about nutrition which the other does not.”\n4) “You learn something new each day.”\n5) “When I played that poker hand, my opponent did know that I saw his cards.”\nEach of these is a statement about knowledge, or the lack thereof. In particular, each compares the states of knowledge of two agents (or the same agent at different times). How can we mathematically model this though?\nThe appropriate and natural mathematical model of a knowledge-state is a sigma-algebra.\nLet \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) be a sigma algebra over some set \\(\\Omega\\) and suppose \\(w\\in\\Omega\\) is the unknown state of a system \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). The knowledge represented by \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is the information about \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) that one obtains from observing for every \\(U \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) whether or not \\(w \\in U\\). Thus, it should be natural that if another sigma algebra \\(\\mathcal{D} \\supset \\mathcal{F}\\) then we say \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) contains “more” information than \\(\\mathcal{F}\\).\n\nIf one remembers back to the first examples of \\(\\sigma\\)-algebras, it becomes obvious that \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\) represents a state of total omniscience, while \\(\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega\\}\\) represents a state of total ignorance.\nLet \\((X, \\mathcal{X})\\) and \\((Y, \\mathcal{Y})\\) be measurable spaces. If \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) contains strictly more information (in the sense that we could recover every bit of information about \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) by observing \\(\\mathcal{X}\\)) than \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) then we say \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) refines \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\). One can think of this as saying once we have observed the information contained in \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), the information in \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) would be redundant.\nWe say that \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) refines \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) if \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathcal{X}\\). This is almost analogous to the discussion of coarse and fine topologies.\nLet \\((X,\\mathcal{X})\\) be a measurable space, and let \\(\\mathbb{T}\\) be a linearly ordered set. A \\(\\mathbb{T}\\)-indexed filtration is a collection \\((\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{T}}\\) of \\(\\sigma\\)-subalgebras of \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) such that, for any \\(s,t\\in\\mathbb{T}\\), \\[\ns &lt; t \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; \\mathcal{F}_s \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_t .\n\\]\nThe opposite of the concept of refinement is the concept of independence. If \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) contains no information about \\(\\mathcal{X},\\) then the information contained in the two \\(\\sigma\\)-algebras is complementary, meaning each one tells us things the other does not.\nHeuristically, if we observed the information about both \\(\\sigma\\)-algebras then we would have “twice” as much information as if we only observed one or the other. We then say \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) are independent of one another. With these ideas in hand, we give a definition for independence of sets and independence of \\(\\sigma\\)-algebras.\nLet \\((X,\\mathcal{X},\\mu)\\) be a measure space, and \\(U,V \\in \\mathcal{X}\\). We say the sets \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are independent if \\[\n\\mu(U \\cap V) \\;=\\; \\mu(U)\\,\\mu(V)\n\\]\nLet \\(\\mathcal{Y}_1, \\mathcal{Y}_2 \\subset \\mathcal{X}\\) be two \\(\\sigma\\)-subalgebras. We say \\(\\mathcal{Y}_1\\) and \\(\\mathcal{Y}_2\\) are independent \\(\\sigma\\)-algebras if every element of \\(\\mathcal{Y}_1\\) is independent of every element of \\(\\mathcal{Y}_2\\) with respect to the measure \\(\\mu\\). In other words, for all \\(U_1 \\in \\mathcal{Y}_1\\) and \\(U_2 \\in \\mathcal{Y}_2\\), we have \\[\n\\mu(U_1 \\cap U_2) \\;=\\; \\mu(U_1)\\,\\mu(U_2)\n\\] i think take this out ### Example: Let \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})\\) be a measurable space and define the function \\(X:\\Omega\\to\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\). We can partition the points in \\(\\Omega\\) into four distinct subsets say \\(A_i:=X^{-1}(i)\\) for \\(i=1,2,3,4\\). Given the value of \\(X\\) at some \\(\\omega\\), we then know which \\(A_i\\) contains \\(\\omega\\) so we can tell whether or not each of the \\(A_i\\)’s happened. Furthermore, \\(\\sigma(X)\\) must contain at least these four events."
