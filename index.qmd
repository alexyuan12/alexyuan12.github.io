Howdy! I am currently finishing up a masterâ€™s degree in Statistics at *California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo* (*Cal Poly SLO* for short). I'm originally from Austin, TX, but I have been enjoying my time out here in the central coast.

I am currently interested in a variety of things including probability, statistics, and ML/AI. Particularly, Optimal Transport and Mechanistic Intepretability are some subjects that I am working towards.
