## Brainteasers

### Drunk Airplane {#airplane}

<div class="problem">


100 people are line up to board an airplane. For convenience, we can assume
that the nth person is assigned the nth seat. However, the first person is drunk
and unfortunately takes a random seat. The boarding process commences and
if a person isnâ€™t able to sit in their assigned seats they will randomly take an
available one. This continues on until the plane has boarded. What is the probability that passenger number 100 ends up in seat 100?


::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}
We can think about this symmetrically. The only two events of interest are
1) the event that seat 1 is filled before seat 100 and 2) the event that seat 100
is filled before seat 1. If 1) occurs then the 100th person gets to sit in their
assigned seat. If 2) occurs then surely passenger number 100 is in the wrong
seat. By symmetry the probability is $\frac{1}{2}$.

## Expected Value

### 4head I {#problem}

<div class="problem">
Varun has 4 fair coins. He flips all 4 at once and checks the parity of each. Varun is now allowed to ***turn over*** any pair of coins. In other words, he is only allowed to turn over a coin if he turns over another. He may iterate this process as many times as he would like to maximize his expected number of heads. What is his expected number of heads?

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}
If Varun flips either $2$ or $4$ heads, he is guaranteed $4$ coins. On the contrary, if Varun flips either $1$ or $3$ heads, he is guaranteed $3$ coins. Thus, the expected value is $\frac{1}{2}(3)+ \frac{1}{2}(4)=3.5$ heads

### 4head II {#problem}

<div class="problem">
Varun has 4 fair coins. He flips all 4 at once and checks the parity of each. Varun is now allowed to ***flip*** any pair of coins. In other words, he is only allowed to flip a coin if he flips another. He may iterate this process as many times as he would like to maximize his expected number of heads. What is his expected number of heads?

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true"}
Varun's optimal strategy is to keep flipping pairs until he has all 4 heads as there is no cost to do so. We can think of this as a Markov chain that will hit an all-heads state with probability 1. Hence, our expected value is 4 heads.
