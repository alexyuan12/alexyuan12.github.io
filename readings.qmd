title: "Readings"

The following are lists of books, papers, and other readings.
I've at least partially read everyone on this list, or I have had the resource recommended to me.

## Books
#### [Analysis:]{.underline}
***Principles of Mathematical Analysis (Walter Rudin):*** \
A notorious undergraduate textbook for good reason. It is very terse on a first read, but it has everything you need to know about analysis at the undergraduate level. Most people who have read this book tend to agree that chapters 1-7 are essential. I don't think this is a good book to learn from unless you have other resources or an instructor. The exercises are pretty difficult. 

***An Introduction to Hilbert Space (Nicholas Young):*** \
An introduction to functional analysis, focusing heavily on the theory of Hilbert spaces and their applications. It's very concise and readable without getting into the more abstract measure theoretical issues. I think this book reads well and has nice exercises built into the body of the text. 

***Analysis (Elliot Lieb, Michael Loss):***\
Supposedly a good introduction to analysis at the graduate level. The focus is more on 'applied' analysis and is good for getting up to speed quickly. I think the book is tailored more to those interested in physics and partial differential equations. I've been told that the exercises are good qualifying exam practice.

***Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications (Gerald Folland):***\
It is a standard analysis textbook at the graduate level along with the other books by Rudin, Royden, etc. It covers measure theory, point-set topology, functional analysis, and some other relevant topics. The analysis done in this book is very general, however it is very well written albeit terse at times. 

*(Currently going through this.)*

***Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces and Partial Differential Equations (Haim Brezis):***\
This is a standard textbook for functional analysis (with a view of PDEs) at the graduate level. I have only read a couple pages about Hanh-Banach, but supposedly it is a must read for those interested in partial differential equations.


#### [Probability:]{.underline}
***Probability Theory and Examples (Rick Durrett):*** \
This is a standard graduate text on probability. It is terse and has some annoying/unstandard notation. I think this book is unreadable if you do not have an instructor handy or previous background in measure theory. I would recommend skipping the measure theory intro if you already know it. Despite these issues, the coverage of topics and examples is great.

*(Currently going through this.)*

***Probability and Measure (Patrick Billingsley):***\
This is supposedly the reference on probability theory. I have skimmed parts of it, and it is very terse. I have been told that if you want to pursue a research career in probability theory, Billingsley is a must read. 

***Measure Theory and Probability Theory (Krishna Athreya, Soumendra Lahiri):***\
This is a book that was just brought to my attention at the time of writing (August 2025). It seems to be sort of similar in spirit to Billingsley, and it takes a general approach from the beginning. Skimming through, it seems to try to offer a lot of intuition on the measure theoretic details.

***High-Dimensional Probability (Roman Vershynin):***\
A book on probability in high dimensions. It is pedagogically sound and is a pretty different flavor compared to other probability texts. No measure theory is requried. The exercises are great, and I think there is a lot of motivation in data science for the results in the book. 

*(Currently going through this.)*

#### [Statistics:]{.underline}
***Statistical Inference (George Casella, Roger Berger):*** \
This is the definitive 'mathematical statistics' book at the masters level. I think many schools also draw their qualifying exam material/questions out of this book. I think it can be a little unmotivated at times and even a bit hand-wavy, but most people think it is the best book around this level. Some people suggest supplementing this book with *Mathematical Statistics with Applications* by Wackerly, et al. as the book is slower and does a better job with motivating the material. 

***Mathematical Statistics (Jun Shao):*** \
A 'mathematical statistics' book at the PhD level. It pretty much expects you to have had a graduate probability course or equivalent from the get-go. It is supposed to prepare you for PhD statistics qualifiers and is a good resource for exercises as there is an associated solutions manual. I am currently going through this.

*(Currently going through this.)*

***High-Dimensional Statistics: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint (Martin Wainwright):*** \


#### [ML/AI:]{.underline}
***Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, et al.) ***\
Considered classic introduction to ML with a statistical view. It's kind of a weird blend of some theory and application. I think the authors underestimate the pre-requisites they state in the beginning. In my opinion, if you don't have a decent linear models/linear algebra background, the book is nearly unreadable.

***Statistical Learning with Sparsity (Hastie, et al.) ***\
I have a copy of this book and it looks like a good exposition of the LASSO (considering Robert Tibshirani is an author), as well as other methods with a focus on sparsity for high dimensions. 

#### [Optimization:]{.underline}
***Numerical Optimization (Jorge Nocedal, Stephen J. Wright):***\

***Convex Optimization (Lieven Vandenberghe, Stephen Boyd):***\


#### [Differential Geometry:]{.underline}
***An Introduction to Manifolds (Loring Tu):*** \
A great introduction to smooth manifolds. The appendix on point-set topology is excellent. 

*(Currently going through this.)*

***Introduction to  Smooth Manifolds (John M. Lee):*** \
Another great introduction to smooth manifolds. This book is much slower than Tu and covers a lot more content. 

*(Currently going through this.)*
